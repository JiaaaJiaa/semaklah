5e0b0bb1-e77c-4669-a3cd-bfc500138791,Clustering Assignment,"The goal of this assignment is to explore and apply clustering algorithms on a dataset to discover inherent groupings among the data points. You will use techniques like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to analyze and interpret the clusters formed.","Your assignment is to select a dataset suitable for clustering and apply K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms to identify inherent groupings. Preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and determine optimal clustering parameters. Evaluate the clusters using appropriate metrics, and compare the results of different algorithms. Analyze and interpret the characteristics of the clusters, providing insights relevant to the dataset's context. Document your process, findings, and insights in a detailed report, and summarize key points in a short presentation. Submit the report, presentation slides, and code files.

5316d3c3-86e0-412d-b66f-966da91678f8,Designing a Simple Digital Clock Using VHDL,"In this assignment, you will design, implement, and simulate a simple digital clock using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The clock will display hours, minutes, and seconds on a simulated seven-segment display. This assignment will help you understand the fundamentals of digital system design, including state machines, counters, and display drivers.","Design a digital clock using VHDL with hour, minute, and second counters that reset after reaching 59 (for seconds and minutes) and 23 (for hours). Implement a 1 Hz clock signal to drive the second counter by dividing a higher frequency clock (e.g., 50 MHz). Design seven-segment display drivers to show the correct time. Create a VHDL project, write the necessary VHDL code for the counters and display drivers, and integrate them into a top-level file. Write a testbench to simulate the clock and verify its functionality over 24 hours of simulated time. Document your design process, including system architecture, module explanations, and simulation results. Submit a zip file with all VHDL source files, the testbench, simulation results, and a PDF design report by [Due Date: e.g., June 20, 2024] via the course's online submission portal. Your work will be evaluated on correctness, design, code quality, simulation, and documentation. Start early, refer to VHDL resources, and collaborate for brainstorming, but ensure your submission is individual work. Good luck, and happy coding!",assignments/1716844394410-CPT411 Assignment 202324.pdf,2024-05-20 00:00:00,2024-05-28 23:59:00,2024-05-27 21:13:37.580893+00,83ca6e46-b578-442e-aeea-fb2467d6d462,false

Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, which could be positive, negative, or neutral. Specifically, you will be working with a dataset consisting of movie reviews and your task will be to build a sentiment classifier that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given review.",Submit in PDF Format.
