52fff3de-4c1a-4d78-9574-b29e2b0a049d,USM23456,23/24,1,Operating systems,CST 232,"To understand the workings of an entire computer system, it begins with an understanding of an operating system. It is because operating system manages every piece of hardware and software. This course is to explore what operating systems are, how they work, what they do and why. Therefore, this course introduces the basic principles of operating system such as memory management, process management, file and device management as well as system programming.",2024-04-02 07:51:16.949691,50,2

Knowledge of programming language paradigm and implementation is very important for students in choosing the appropriate programming language to effectively solve programming problems. Students will be exposed to basic concepts of implementation such as components involved in the compilation and interpretation of programming languages. This course also covers the basic concepts of programming language paradigm such as basic data types and program control structures. The paradigms of the programming language involved are imperative (object), function and logic.",2024-04-01 15:29:51.261841,40,1
b0af00b4-90c7-4993-ac30-9ac9b4f2fb69,USM78901,23/24,2,Natural Language Processing,CPC 353,"Natural language processing is one of the fundamental courses in the area of artificial intelligence and big data analysis. This course introduces fundamental concepts in text and speech processing to students. Students will be introduced to the elementary knowledge and processing in speech such as the physics, phoneme, formant, pronunciation model, and speech features. In the text processing, preprocessing and modelling techniques such as tokenization, stemming, morphological analysis, sequence modelling, grammar, parsing, and semantic modelling will be discussed. The concepts and techniques will also be demonstrated in applications such as text classification, information retrieval, machine translation and automatic speech recognition.",2024-04-01 11:47:59.638059,30,10
