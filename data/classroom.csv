USM23456,23/24,2,Intelligent Computing Major Project,CAT 405,"This main objective of this course is to provide an opportunity for students to study the field of intelligent computing in depth. It also provides the students an
opportunity to enhance their ability in designing system, analysing algorithms and using the theories learned. Students are given an opportunity to develop an
intelligent/smart system or application using appropriate programming language and tools. Students are also given an opportunity to learn new topics without formal classes, and learn how to find references, write reports, give 
 seminars, present their work and manage their time.",50
USM12345,23/24,1,Management and Engineering of Databases,CMT 321,"The first part of this course covers concepts, techniques and protocols related to transaction, concurrency control, recovery and security of databases. In the second part
of the course, students will learn about the haracteristics, components and data design of other types of databases (distributed databases, object-oriented databases) as well as data warehouse, OLAP and data mining. Students also will investigate issues and latest development in database applications and technologies.
At the end of the course, the students will be able to:
- Explain concepts, methods and protocol of transaction, concurrency control,
recovery and security for database.
- Differentiate characteristics, components and types of database.
- Report on issues and latest development in databases.",40
USM79801,23/24,2,Natural Language Processing,CPC353,"Natural language processing is one of the fundamental courses in the area of artificial intelligence and big data analysis. This course introduces fundamental concepts in text and speech processing to students. Students will be introduced to the elementary knowledge and processing in speech such as the physics, phoneme, formant, pronunciation model, and speech features. In the text processing, preprocessing and modelling techniques such as tokenization, stemming, morphological analysis, sequence modelling, grammar, parsing, and semantic modelling will be discussed. The concepts and techniques will also be demonstrated in applications such as text classification, information retrieval, machine translation and automatic speech recognition.",50
,23/24,1,Programming Language Implementation and Paradigms,CPT316,"The essence of this course is to expose students to the existence of various programming language paradigms and implementation. Knowledge of programming language paradigm and implementation is very important for students in choosing the appropriate programming language to effectively solve programming problems. Students will be exposed to basic concepts of implementation such as components involved in the compilation and interpretation of programming languages. This course also covers the basic concepts of programming language paradigm such as basic data types and program control structures. The paradigms of the programming language involved are imperative (object), function and logic.",40
