,23/24,2,Intelligent Computing Major Project,CAT 405,"This main objective of this course is to provide an opportunity for students to study the field of intelligent computing in depth. It also provides the students an
opportunity to enhance their ability in designing system, analysing algorithms and using the theories learned. Students are given an opportunity to develop an
intelligent/smart system or application using appropriate programming language and tools. Students are also given an opportunity to learn new topics without formal classes, and learn how to find references, write reports, give 
 seminars, present their work and manage their time.",50
,23/24,1,Management and Engineering of Databases,CMT 321,"The first part of this course covers concepts, techniques and protocols related to transaction, concurrency control, recovery and security of databases. In the second part
of the course, students will learn about the haracteristics, components and data design of other types of databases (distributed databases, object-oriented databases) as well as data warehouse, OLAP and data mining. Students also will investigate issues and latest development in database applications and technologies.
At the end of the course, the students will be able to:
- Explain concepts, methods and protocol of transaction, concurrency control,
recovery and security for database.
- Differentiate characteristics, components and types of database.
- Report on issues and latest development in databases.",40
,23/24,2,Natural Language Processing,CPC353,"Natural language processing is one of the fundamental courses in the area of artificial intelligence and big data analysis. This course introduces fundamental concepts in text and speech processing to students. Students will be introduced to the elementary knowledge and processing in speech such as the physics, phoneme, formant, pronunciation model, and speech features. In the text processing, preprocessing and modelling techniques such as tokenization, stemming, morphological analysis, sequence modelling, grammar, parsing, and semantic modelling will be discussed. The concepts and techniques will also be demonstrated in applications such as text classification, information retrieval, machine translation and automatic speech recognition.",50
,23/24,1,Programming Language Implementation and Paradigms,CPT 316,"The essence of this course is to expose students to the existence of various programming language paradigms and implementation. Knowledge of programming language paradigm and implementation is very important for students in choosing the appropriate programming language to effectively solve programming problems. Students will be exposed to basic concepts of implementation such as components involved in the compilation and interpretation of programming languages. This course also covers the basic concepts of programming language paradigm such as basic data types and program control structures. The paradigms of the programming language involved are imperative (object), function and logic.",40
,23/24,1,Operating systems,CST 232,"To understand the workings of an entire computer system, it begins with an understanding of an operating system. It is because operating system manages every piece of hardware and software. This course is to explore what operating systems are, how they work, what they do and why. Therefore, this course introduces the basic principles of operating system such as memory management, process management, file and device management as well as system programming.",50
USM56789,23/24,2,Principles of Computer Networks and Information Security,CST 235,"This course exposes to the students the general knowledge, principles and technologies that are related to the network system and security in computing contexts. For the network system aspects, students are exposed to the principals of data communications, architecture and types of network such as LAN, WAN, Internet: network topology, network protocols, network models especially OSI and TCP/IP also standard used in regards to addressing, IPv6. For security aspects, students are exposed to the general knowledge of security which is concepts and models of CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability); risk concepts, threat, weaknesses and attack also its vector; The principals of authentication and authorization and access control; trust and trustworthiness concepts, and secure system development. Besides, students will be exposed with knowledge about threat to human resources and the roles that should be played by them in security system.",40
USM90123,23/24,2,Digital Systems Design,CST 236,"This course aims are to make sure student able to analyze, design and evaluate digital system circuits, of medium complexity, that are based on microcontroller interfacing with MWICOM and related electronic devices to construct a functional digital system.",50
,23/24,1,Web Engineering & Technologies,CMT 322,"Web Engineering introduces a structured methodology utilized in software engineering to Web development projects. The course address the concepts, methods, technologies, and techniques of developing Web sites that collect, organize and expose information resources. Topics covered include requirements engineering for Web applications, design methods and technologies, interface design, usability of web applications, accessibility, testing, metrics, operation and maintenance of Web applications, security, and project management.",40
,23/24,1,Information Systems Theory and Management,CMT 323,"Information systems are enablers for modern organizational activities, as well as drivers of new and modified goals and activities. Information Systems management is very much related to the organizational strategy, goals and operations. At the same time, the technical nature of information systems and the rapid changes in technology make unique demands to managers. This course provides the basis for understanding the role and activities of information systems in organizations. It is also a valuable complement to the theoretical and technical material you have studied in other courses.",50
